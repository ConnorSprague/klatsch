What is Klatsch?

The purpose of the Klatsch framework is to provide an easy-to-program, flexible
interface for exploring and analyzing feeds of social media data.   It's meant
to be easy to interface to existing algorithms and graph representations and to
produce pretty pictures in a variety of formats.  The language itself is
somewhere between Python and Scheme: dynamic types, procedures as first-class
data, call-by-value semantics, and a nod toward object orientation.

Klatsch is built around a scripting language implemented by an interpreter
written in Java.  You don’t need to know how to program Java in order to
develop Klatsch scripts; that’s only necessary if you want to extend or modify
the interpreter itself.
