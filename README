Welcome to Klatsch!

What is Klatsch?

Klatsch is an interactive Java application for analyzing time series data from social media.
It's meant to be easy to interface to existing algorithms and graph representations and to
produce pretty pictures in a variety of formats.

Things are a bit messy and fluid right now while I finish fleshing out the core language
features and the framework for future expansion.  The language itself is somewhere between
Python and Scheme: dynamic types, procedures as first-class data, call-by-value semantics,
and a nod toward object orientation.

When things stabilize more, this file will contain more of a road map to the code.

I aim to make sure the current version in the repository is always executable.

Any questions?  Ask!
