This is Mark's current work list of things to do to Klatsch to hasten it along its merry way.

* begin digging into a GUI rewrite
* introduce file I/O
* add native methods for exporting list and matrix data
* add support for printf-style formatting
* implement the Factory pattern to make the graph implementation genuinely pluggable

Mark's notes-to-self on node annotation:

  The current implementation is to add a "data" field to each node.
  A better way would be to provide a dictionary of attributes to the layout routine:
   { attr1 : { id1 : val1, ... }, attr2 : { id2 : val2, ... } }
